This plugin shows an image preview of what a post would look like when viewed on mobile.  The image preview shows in a column on the posts page in wp-admin.  

== Description ==

Using the screenshotmachine.com api a column is added to the list of posts that displays a screen cap from a mobile device.  By no means does this replace device testing!  I use it because I often write extremely long titles and I want to make sure that my title doesn't run more than 1 mobile screen long.

== Installation ==

1. Install from repository
2. Register for an account at screenshotmachine.com  (100 free screenshots/month).
3. Add your api key to the Screen Menu Settings Page.
4. Dance like no one is watching!
5. Right click on the screenshots and open in a new window if you want to see it in all its glory.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

Because it's really easy to use.  

== Screenshots ==

1. Set your API key form screenshotmachine.com and turn on display for either desktop view, mobile view, or both.
2. This is how the screenshots will display in the posts view.  A simple screenshot of your choice to the right side of the columns displayed.
